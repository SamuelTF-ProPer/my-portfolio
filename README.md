# I am Samuel Tarifa Flores
### What do I do?
Right now I am studiying to be a developer of web aplications since i'ts a job that I enjoy and also aligns with my objectives on the long run. At the moment I'm trying to upgrade my skills (mainly coding and video editing) because at some point in my life I would like to develop videogames of my own.

### What am I going to do to acomplish my objective?
First off i'm already doing things towards my goal, right now I am learning to code (for the videogame and the job) and also I am trying to grow my youtube chanel (which will be used to promote the game once it's made). However a lot of people coud clasify my actions as foolish and naive, due to this I am studiying to become a developer of web aplications to maintain myself economically while I strive for my Objectives. Once I land in a stable job I have a small roadmap for the objectives I have to acomplish to reach my objective:
  1. Grow my YouTube channel until I can live off of it
  2. Leave my job and work full-time on the YouTube Chanel until I can live off of it and pay an editor
  3. Keep on creating videos with the help of my editor and start developing my game
  4. Once its on a late stage of developement start making videos about it and fund it with the money I make off of them

### Why do you need the YouTube channel?
It is true that it seems like an useless step, but its actually a good investment. So even if YouTube takes a lot of time which will be a problem at the begining once i can pay an editor all i have to do is write the scripts and the voice lines for each video. Meaning that i will have a source of income (After a lot of hard work) which will allow me to work 2 hours a day at most while i have all of the other time to develop my videogame

Also something which is very important for any videogame developer is their reach (the amount of people that will know about their game once it's out) Creating a videogame it's no easy task, and it takes a lot of time which would be wasted if barely anyone knows about it. Due to this the YouTube chanel is integral to my plan since it will allow me to have a very big amount of players as soon as it is released

# What is my formation at the moment?
However, until I can actually start living off of those, I first need to get a job that will support me financially. For that, I am still studying to gain more knowledge and skills. What I have done so far related to IT is:
  - Technician in Microinformatic Systems and Networks
  - CISCO (Placeholder)
  - Technician in Development of Web Applications (In progress)

### My experience with coding
I first started coding when I was thirteen years old. I tried to learn C# to create video games in Unity, but my PC was too old for that, so I eventually stopped due to hardware limitations. After this, when I was 16, I tried to create a video game again, this time in Godot. With a new PC, it was finally possible since I didn't lack the hardware to do so. In Godot, I learned GDScript, a programming language created specifically for Godot. GDScript is basically C++ but with all of the functionalities from the Godot engine integrated.

I have gotten very good at GDscript, however the code used in videogames is often a lot simpler than the one used on different tasks, due to this I am learning Python at the moment.

### My experience with mark-up languages
I first started using this while studiying for the tittle of Technician in Microinformatic Systems and Networks, on here we were tasked with creating a non-functional web page, while this isnt very useful i learned to use HTML and CSS very well, now im studiying to use different mark-up languages like JSON and Java-Script
