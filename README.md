# My Portfolio
### Who am I?
Hello, I am Samuel Tarifa Flores, a person who codes mostly for fun (and also to get a job). My main objective right now is to develop my skills (coding, 3D modeling, and video editing mainly). The reason for that is that I am a person who likes to do things overall and is often doing projects on his own. Right now, my two main projects are:
  - My videogame (On hiatus until i am better at 3D modeling)
  - My youtube chanel (I am slowly getting to something)

However, until I can actually start living off of those, I first need to get a job that will support me financially. For that, I am still studying to gain more knowledge and skills. What i have done so far related to IT is:
  - Technician in Microinformatic Systems and Networks
  - CISCO (Placeholder)
  - Technician in Development of Web Applications (In progress)

### My experience with coding
I first started coding when I was thirteen years old. I tried to learn C# to create video games in Unity, but my PC was too old for that, so I eventually stopped due to hardware limitations. After this, when I was 16, I tried to create a video game again, this time in Godot. With a new PC, it was finally possible since I didn't lack the hardware to do so. In Godot, I learned GDScript, a programming language created specifically for Godot. GDScript is basically C++ but with all of the functionalities from the Godot engine integrated.

I have gotten very good at GDscript, however the code used in videogames is often a lot simpler than the one used on different tasks, due to this I am learning Python at the moment.

### My experience with mark-up languages
I first started using this while studiying for the tittle of Technician in Microinformatic Systems and Networks, on here we were tasked with creating a non-functional web page, while this isnt very useful i learned to use HTML and CSS very well, now im studiying to use different mark-up languages like JSON and Java-Script
